# video-Suli-Hu
1. Implemented python threading to put a finite number of tasks in the pool, the extra numbers of tasks will be put in a queue as a waiting list.
2. Used Twitter API and python CV and PIL tools to grab the target user timeline tweets and draw them into pictures, then make video for each users. This is the single task as one thread in the threads pool.
3. Used `flake8` to do some simple syntax checking and test.
